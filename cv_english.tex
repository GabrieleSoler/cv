\section{Summary}

Hi, I am a software developer, mainly working with front-end technologies.
\bigskip

I have been fascinated by computers ever since I can remember, initially as an entertainment tool, and eventually using them as means to exercise my logical skills and express myself through software. I started coding at school when I was 15 years old and have being doing it ever since.
\bigskip

Writing software professionally since 2019, I have worked both with back-end and front-end, using languages such as Javascript, Typescript, ReactJs, Ext.Js and C\#.
